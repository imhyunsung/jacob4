            <h4>2. There will be a major economic crisis in America.</h4>
            <h2>1.Jacob
            </h2>
            <p>Jacob had the love of God.<br/>
                God wanted to give Jacob his heritage.<br/>
                So he gives Jacob a dream.<br/>
                Jacob knew the dream of God.<br/>
                Nonetheless, as time came closer for Esau to be blessed as the firstborn son, Jacob lost his patience.<br/>
                So he is blessed as a firstborn son in a human way.</p>
                
                <p>Jacob dreams in Bethel.<br/>
                Jacob prays for himself.<br/>
                “If you protect me, you will become my creator.”</p>
                
                <p>God remedies Jacob’s strayed mind.<br/>
                That is why Jacob’s suffering took so long.</p>
                
                <p>Laban deceives Jacob.<br/>
                God gives a helping hand to Jacob.<br/>
                Jacob was born grasping Easu’s heel, but now he holds on to God.</p>
                
                <p>God gives a new name to Jacob.<br/>
                Why did God tell Jacob to fulfill his vow?<br/>
                Just as people dream, God also dreams.<br/>
                Jacob’s dream is not his own dream. It is also God’s dream.<br/>
                God and Jacob, together, make their dream come true.</p>
                
                <p>Jesus came to accomplish Jacob’s dream.<br/>
                Jesus came to Jacob’s house as king.<br/>
                The children of Israel return and construct the house of God.</p>

<p>In that day the remnant of Israel, the survivors of the house of Jacob, will no longer rely on him who struck them down but will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
    A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God.
    (Isaiah 10:20-21)
    </p>
<p>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
    and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."

<h2>4.The Law
</h2>
<p>God has given the law to Jews.<br/>
    Its purpose was to teach God's love.<br/>
    However, the Jews failed.<br/>
    It's because the law only ever existed as knowledge.</p>
    
    <p>Thus, how can we teach God's love to the Jewish people?<br/>
    Jesus must come in person.<br/>
    Jesus came to fulfill the law, not to eliminate it.</p>
    
    <p>Was there something wrong with Moses bringing the law?<br/>
    Moses is innocent.<br/>
    Moses was a faithful servant to the house of God to maintain the testimony of the future.</p>
    
    <p>Who is Peter?<br/>
    He confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, whereas everyone else refers to him as a prophet.<br/>
    But Jesus had something he wanted to hear from Peter.<br/>
    “Peter, do you love me?”</p>
    
    <p>Seek the face of God.<br/>
    It is impossible for the human mind to know God.<br/>

<p>Then they will know that I am the LORD their God, for though I sent them into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own land, not leaving any behind. (Ezekiel 39:28)</p>
<p>The United States will become perilous if all Jews leave. “Sons and daughters of Israel will return and build God’s house,” declares God. I do not see this prophecy as a symbol. I see it as a true occurrence that will happen in the future. I call this the ‘New Exodus.’</p>

<p>I think that the salvation history of God and the profane history are entwined like gears. The most likely scenario, in my opinion, for a “New Exodus” to take place is through an economic crisis in the United States.

</p>
<p>Experts in economics claim that worrying about the US dollar is pointless. But I think the power of America can’t be maintained forever because I believe in the prophets.

    <p>The global order of the United States is currently threatened, and a New World Order will be established on top of it.

<p>
    Q. When does Israel recover? When does Jesus arrive?

</p>
A. Only God knows. (Acts 1:7)

<p>
    However, everyone can express his or her own thoughts. I will tell you mine based on the Bible.
 
</p>

<p>
    Ishaiah 61:1-2 is quoted in Luke 4:18-19; however, ‘to proclaim the day of vengeance of our God (Ishaiah 61:2)’ is missing from verse 19.

</p>
Jesus took on the shape of a servant when He first appeared. The Second Advent judges his enemies in an appearance of a king. 
The land does not vanish, but refreshed in Christ.

<p>
    It is very possible, in my opinion, that He will appear as a king in 2064, the year of the Jubilee.
</p>

<p>
    Q. So when will the ‘New Exodus’ happen?

</p>
<p>
    A. The ‘New Exodus’ will happen in 2034 if one generation is calculated 30 years from 2064.
(The definition of one generation could be different.)

</p>

<p>
    "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.
I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. (Matthew 24:32-34)
